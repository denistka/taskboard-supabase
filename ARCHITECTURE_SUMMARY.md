# 🚀 TASKBOARD ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

## 📊 CURRENT STATE (Oct 2025)

**Architecture:** Vue 3 (Main Thread) ↔ WebSocket ↔ Node.js Server ↔ Supabase

**Quality Scores:**
- Code Quality: **A+ (9/10)** ✅ Clean, TypeScript, DRY principle
- Performance: **C+ (7/10)** ⚠️ N+1 queries, memory leaks, excessive broadcasts
- Scalability: **D (5/10)** 🔴 Max ~500 concurrent users
- Architecture: **B- (7.5/10)** ⚠️ Tight coupling, everything in main thread

---

## 🎯 TARGET ARCHITECTURE (Q1-Q2 2026)

```
UI Layer (Main Thread)          → Only DOM rendering & user events
    ↓ postMessage
GPU Layer (OffscreenCanvas)     → WebGL in Worker, parallel compute
    ↓ bitmap/TypedArrays
Worker Layer (Web Workers)      → State management, network, CRDT
    ↓ WebRTC
P2P Mesh (Decentralized)        → WebRTC DataChannels, CRDT sync
```

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (5)

### 1. Monolithic State in Main Thread
- All composables (useTasks, useBoards) work in main thread
- Blocks UI on large state updates
- **Fix:** Create `StateManager` class, prepare for Worker migration

### 2. WebSocket Client in Main Thread
- JSON parsing blocks UI on large messages
- Cannot scale to Worker
- **Fix:** Create `NetworkBridge` interface, Worker adapter

### 3. WebGL Rendering Without OffscreenCanvas
- Buffer creation/deletion every frame → memory leak risk
- Blocks UI during rendering
- **Fix:** Reuse buffers, add cleanup, prepare for OffscreenCanvas

### 4. No Network Abstraction Layer
- Direct WebSocket coupling in all composables
- Cannot switch to P2P/CRDT
- **Fix:** Create pluggable `NetworkBridge` (WebSocket/WebRTC/CRDT)

### 5. Server: Monolithic MessageHandler
- 245 lines, 30+ switch cases
- Hard to scale and test
- **Fix:** Command Pattern - split into separate handlers

## ⚡ QUICK WINS (6.5 hours total)

| Task | Time | File | Impact |
|------|------|------|--------|
| WebGL Buffer Reuse | 2h | `webglRenderer.ts` | 50% less GPU memory |
| Fix N+1 Queries | 2h | `BoardManager.ts` | 5x faster loading |
| Connection Indexing | 2h | `ConnectionManager.ts` | 10x faster broadcasts |
| Shared Supabase Client | 30m | Create `supabase.ts` | Better pooling |

**Result:** Massive performance boost with minimal effort 🚀

## 📋 3-STAGE ACTION PLAN

### STAGE 1: Performance Fixes (Week 1 - 11 hours)
- [ ] Fix N+1 database queries in `BoardManager.ts` (2h)
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in `BasePresenceManager.ts` (3h)
- [ ] Optimize broadcast scope (only send to relevant users) (4h)
- [ ] Add connection indexing by board (2h)

**Result:** 5x performance, support 500+ users

### STAGE 2: Architecture Prep (Week 2-3 - 12 hours)
- [ ] WebGL buffer reuse + cleanup (2-3h)
- [ ] Create `StateManager` class (4-6h)
- [ ] Create `NetworkBridge` interface (3-4h)
- [ ] Server Command Pattern refactor (1d)

**Result:** Ready for Worker/P2P migration

### STAGE 3: Worker Migration (Week 4-6 - 6 days)
- [ ] Move WebSocket to `NetworkWorker` (2d)
- [ ] Implement OffscreenCanvas rendering (2d)
- [ ] Move state to `StateWorker` (2d)

**Result:** Full multi-layer architecture

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

**After Stage 1 (Week 1):**
```
Max Users:       500 → 5,000+
Memory Leaks:    YES → FIXED ✅
N+1 Queries:     YES → FIXED ✅
Performance:     C+ → A- (9/10)
```

**After Stage 3 (Week 6):**
```
Performance:     A (9.5/10)
Scalability:     A (9/10)
Architecture:    A (9/10)
Features:        UI never blocks, GPU in Worker, Network offload
```

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY GOOD

- Clean Manager Pattern (BaseManager, BasePresenceManager)
- Composable architecture (Vue 3 Composition API)
- Shared types (`/shared/types.ts`)
- WebGL particle system (good separation of concerns)
- Modern UI (Glass morphism, smooth transitions)
- Excellent bundle size (~240KB)

---

## 🎨 ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

1. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself (use base classes)
2. **Cellular Independence** - Each module works independently
3. **Tree-like Dependencies** - No circular deps (StateManager → Composables → Components)
4. **Minimal Code, Fast App** - Code splitting, tree shaking
